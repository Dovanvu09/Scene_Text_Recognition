## Introduction

Scene Text Recognition involves detecting and recognizing text from natural scene images. This project aims to create a pipeline that integrates various components, such as text detection and recognition, to enable end-to-end scene text understanding.

## Models Implemented

### YOLOv8 Object Detection

- The model file `yolov8s.pt` is used to perform object detection in images, helping to identify regions that may contain text.
- YOLOv8 is utilized for its efficiency in detecting potential text areas.

### Text Detection

- Implemented in the notebook `Text_Detection.ipynb`.
- This component uses advanced detection techniques to identify areas of an image that contain text, serving as the first step in the recognition pipeline.

### Text Recognition with CRNN and ResNet

- Implemented in `Text_Recognition_CRNN_ResNet.ipynb`.
- This model leverages CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) with ResNet as the backbone to recognize text in detected regions.
- CRNN allows the model to handle sequences of characters, making it suitable for recognizing text from images.

### Full Pipeline

- The complete pipeline is provided in `__STR__Full_PipeLine.ipynb`.
- This notebook integrates YOLOv8 for text detection and CRNN with ResNet for text recognition, enabling an end-to-end solution for scene text recognition.

## Installation

To use this repository, clone it and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dovanvu09/Scene_Text_Recognition.git
cd Scene_Text_Recognition
```

### Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux or macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Git LFS

This project contains large files that exceed the GitHub size limit of 100 MB. To manage these files, Git Large File Storage (LFS) is used:

1. Install Git LFS from [Git LFS Release Page](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

2. Run the following commands:

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pt"
git lfs track "*.ipynb"
```

3. Commit the `.gitattributes` file:

```sh
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

## Usage

### Running the Models

1. **Text Detection**: Open the notebook `Text_Detection.ipynb` and run each cell to perform text detection on images.
2. **Text Recognition**: Use `Text_Recognition_CRNN_ResNet.ipynb` for text recognition in the detected regions.
3. **Full Pipeline**: The entire process from detection to recognition is available in `__STR__Full_PipeLine.ipynb`.

### Training Custom Models

If you wish to train your own models, replace the datasets in the `Datasets/` folder and modify the notebooks accordingly.

### Sample Data

To test the pipeline, you can use the sample images available in the `Datasets/` directory.

## Results

Here is an example of the output generated by our complete pipeline:
